### Team Graph
****
```{r, echo=FALSE}

milksub <- milk %>%
  filter(state %in% c('Texas','Colorado','Connecticut', 'Alaska', 'California')) %>%
  select(state, year, milk_million)

ggplot(data = milksub, aes(x = year, y = milk_million, color = state)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle('Milk Produced over time by State') +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Milk Produced (Million lbs.)')

```


 
* In this lab, we thought using the dyplr functions and storing variables were most helpful in learning about the data. Using these functions helped us analyze the data, to find which state for exery year, produced the most milk. Storing variables helped us select and maniputalte specific data we wanted to show in our tables or in our graphs.

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
minyear <- milk %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(milk_million, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
 top_n(-1,total) 
minyear 
```

* 1975 is the year when the least milk was produced in the United States

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
 
mostyear <- milk %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(milk_million, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
   top_n(1,total)
mostyear 
  
```

* 2017 is the year when the most milk was produced in the United States


```{r, echo=FALSE} 

five_least_states <- milk %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>% 
    top_n(-5,milk_million) %>% arrange(milk_million)

five_least_states 
```

* In 2017, the 5 states that produced the least milk were Alaska, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Arkansas, and Alabama in that order


```{r, echo=FALSE}
 
five_most_states <- milk %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>% 
 top_n(5,milk_million) %>% arrange(desc(milk_million))
   
five_most_states 
``` 

* In 2017, the 5 states that produced the most milk were Californaia Wisconsin, New York, Idaho and Texas in that order.

#### Arie's Data
****
```{r, echo=FALSE}

milk1996 <- milk %>% filter(year == 1996) 
ggplot(data = milk1996 , mapping = aes(x = milk_million ))+
  geom_density()+
  ggtitle('Distribution of Milk Production in 1996')+
  xlab('Milk Produced(Millions lbs.)')+
  ylab('Density')

```

* The mean and median millions of pounds of milk are 3080.12 and 1480, respectively, as shown in the first data frame.  California produces the most milk and Alaska produces the least amount of milk as shown in data frames two and three.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#### Who Did What?
****
* Arie: Made team graph, typed what was helpful section, created repo

* Ryan: Found the 5 states that produced the least and most milk in 2017. Also found the year in which the most and least milk was produced.

* Anderson: Helped edit data set and created an indiviudal graph.

* Ethan: Helped edit data set and created an indiviudal graph. Edited merge conflicts and errors. 

* David: Tibble creation for each year and formating doc. Added informative bullets under graphs and tables. Gave cookies to teammates.
